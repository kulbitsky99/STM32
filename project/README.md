# STM32.Programming microcontrollers
## GPIO
This is an interesting program, which allows you to reflect any numbers from 0 to 9999 to the seven-segment indicator and increase it by USER-button. There is also a contact-debouncing defense system, which allows to increment number properly(without several increments by one push and sudden consequences).
Look at the pictures and enjoy!
